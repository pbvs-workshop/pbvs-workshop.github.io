Abstract: Since its inception in 2004, the Perception Beyond the Visible Spectrum workshop series (IEEE PBVS) has been one of the key events in the computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR) community featuring imaging, sensing and exploitation algorithms in the non-visible spectrum (infrared, thermal, radar, SAR, millimeters wave, LiDAR, â€¦) for various applications including autonomous driving, aerial robotics, remote sensing, surveillance, and medical applications. This year PBVS hosts three keynote speakers from NASA, FLIR, and UCB/Standford, and includes 23 papers in the program. The best paper award is sponsored by TuSimple.
