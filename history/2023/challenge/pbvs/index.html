                    <p align="justify">Image super-resolution is an ill-posed problem that refers to the task of going from a low-resolution image to a high-resolution image; this can be used in a wide range of real-world applications, such as surveillance and security, medicine, military, amongst others. Deep convolutional network based super-resolution techniques have witnessed remarkable progress, where most of the state-of-the-art are focused on visible domain. Thermal images have become a major tool in several fields, unfortunately due to physical limitations of the technology and the high cost of thermal camera, these images tend to have poor resolution.</p>

                    <p align="justify">As mentioned above, in general, thermal images have a poor resolution that could be improved by using learning-based traditional super-resolution methods, which have been large used in the visible spectral domain. Learning-based super-resolution methods works by downsampling and adding noises and blur to the given image. These noisy and blurred poor quality images, together with the given images (which are used as the Ground Truths), are used in the learning process.</p>
					<p align="justify">The approach mention above, has been mostly used to tackle the super-resolution problem, however there are few contributions where the learning process is based on the usage of a pair images (low and a high-resolution images) obtained from different cameras. For the current challenge, a novel thermal image <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dataset">dataset</a> has been created, containing images with three different resolutions (low, mid, high) obtained with three different thermal cameras. <b>The challenge consists in creating a solution capable of generating super-resolution images in x2, x3 and x4 scale from each resolution, in the case of x2 an additional evaluation will be performed by using a HR image obtained from another camera.</b> The results from each team will be <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#evaluation">evaluated</a> in two ways.</p>

                    <p align="justify">A dataset has been created using three different thermal cameras, in order to have real scenarios, with different conditions and objects. Each camera has a different resolution (low, mid, high). The technical information is shown below in <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#table1">Table 1</a> and illustrations from each camera depicted in <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

                    <p align="justify">PSNR and structural similarity (SSIM) measures are going to be corrupted over a small set of images left for evaluating the performance of the proposed solution. Two kinds of evaluations are going to be performed. For the first evaluation, a set of 10 downsampled and noisy images will be shared for traditional evaluation as shown in <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#evaluation01">Fig. 2</a>. For the second evaluation a set of 10 real images, from the MR dataset, will be shared. In this case, the obtained SR images will be compared with the corresponding real High Resolution semi-paired images, as shown in <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#evaluation02">Fig. 3</a>. For the second evaluation, HR images are going to be registered with the computed SR images in order to use PSRN & SSIM metrics.</p>

The average evaluation value will be computed as follows:<br/><center><img src="img/formula02.png" width="20%" /></center>where EVAL is PSNR and SSIM measures, and N is the number of validation images (note that EVAL will be applied just on a part of the image to avoid regions without overlap due to the bias of the cameras).</li>
