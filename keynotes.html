                            <p align="justify"><strong>Bio:</strong>Le Lu received a PhD in 2007 from Johns Hopkins University. During his first six years at Siemens, he made significant contributions to the company’s CT colonography and Lung CAD product lines. From 2013 to 2017, Dr. Lu served as a staff scientist in the Radiology and Imaging Sciences department of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. He then went on to found Nvidia’s medical image analysis group and he held the position of senior research manager until June 2018. Since then, he has been the Executive Director at PAII Inc., Bethesda Research lab, Maryland, USA which has become one of the leading industrial research labs in medical imaging. He was the main technical leader for two of the most-impactful public radiology image dataset releases (NIH ChestXray14, NIH DeepLesion 2018). He won NIH Clinical Center Director Award in 2017, NIN Mentor of the year award in 2015, and won numerous best paper awards in MICCAI and RSNA.</p>
