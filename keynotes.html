                                <p align="justify"><strong>Bio:</strong>Richard Bamler studied Electrical Engineering and received his PhD and his ‘Habilitation’ in 1986 and 1988, respectively, from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) where he worked on optical signal processing, holography and wave propagation. He joined the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in 1989, where he is currently the Director of the Remote Sensing Technology Institute. In 1994 and 1996, respectively, Richard Bamler was a visiting scientist at NASA-JPL and a guest professor at the University of Innsbruck. Since 2003 he has been full professor at TUM as a double appointment with his DLR position. His research interests are in algorithms for optimum information extraction from remote sensing data. This involves new estimation algorithms, like sparse reconstruction and compressive sensing for SAR, multi-/hyperspectral imaging, data fusion and machine learning. Richard Bamler, his team, and his institute have been developing algorithms and operational processing systems for almost all German and many European Earth observation satellite missions, covering a wide range of remote sensing technologies from radar and optical imaging to atmospheric sounding.</p>
