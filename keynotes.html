                                <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 3D object detection is an essential task in autonomous driving. Recent techniques excel with highly accurate detection rates, provided the 3D input data is obtained from precise but expensive LiDAR technology. Approaches based on cheaper monocular or stereo imagery data have, until recently, resulted in drastically lower accuracies - a gap that was commonly attributed to poor image-based depth estimation. In this talk we argue that it is not the precision or quality of the data, but its representation that accounts for the majority of the difference. Taking the inner workings of convolutional neural networks into consideration, we propose to convert image-based depth maps to pseudo-LiDAR representations - essentially mimicking the LiDAR signal. With this representation we can apply different existing LiDAR-based detection algorithms. Our approaches yield impressive improvements on the popular KITTI 3D object detection benchmark data set, and have already been adapted by the self-driving car community.</p>

                                <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Thanks to neural networks (NNs), faster computation, and massive datasets, machine learning (ML) is under increasing pressure to provide automated solutions to even harder real-world tasks beyond human performance with ever faster response times due to potentially huge technological and societal benefits. Unsurprisingly, the NN learning formulations present a fundamental challenge to the back-end learning algorithms despite their scalability, in particular due to the existence traps in the non-convex optimization landscape, such as saddle points, that can prevent algorithms to obtain “good” solutions.<br><br> In this talk, we describe our recent research that has demonstrated that the non-convex optimization dogma is false by showing that scalable stochastic optimization algorithms can avoid traps and rapidly obtain locally optimal solutions. Coupled with the progress in representation learning, such as over-parameterized neural networks, such local solutions can be globally optimal. <br><br>Unfortunately, this talk will also demonstrate that the central min-max optimization problems in ML, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), robust reinforcement learning (RL), and distributionally robust ML, contain spurious attractors that do not include any stationary points of the original learning formulation. Indeed, we will describe how algorithms are subject to a grander challenge, including unavoidable convergence failures, which could explain the stagnation in their progress despite the impressive earlier demonstrations.</p>
